# Tutorial I.III - Comparison Operators


# Introduction

Imagine you’re teaching a computer to make decisions. Just like we
compare things in everyday life (“Is it raining?”, “Do I have enough
money?”), computers need ways to compare values and make choices. This
tutorial will show you how to help computers make these comparisons!

Follow the instructions, write your code in the designated code blocks,
and execute the corresponding code cell.

# Section 1 - Comparisons

In everyday life, we make comparisons all the time:

- Is this coffee too hot?
- Do I have enough money for lunch?
- Is my password correct?

In Julia, we use special symbols to make these comparisons. Comparisons
return a boolean value (true or false). You can use these directly or
store them in a variable. For example:

``` julia
user_input = "secret123"
password_correct = (user_input == "secret123")
```

    true

``` julia
coffee_temp = 75
temperature_safe = (coffee_temp <= 70)
```

    false

The following are potential real-world examples:

``` julia
# Do I have enough money?
enough_money = (wallet >= price)    
# Is the person an adult?
is_adult = (age >= 18)            
# Is this person Elio?
same_name = (name == "Elio")     
```

Here are all the comparison operators:

| Symbol | Meaning                  | Real-world Example              |
|--------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `==`   | Equal to                 | Is my password correct?         |
| `!=`   | Not equal to             | Is this a different person?     |
| `<`    | Less than                | Is it colder than freezing?     |
| `>`    | Greater than             | Do I have more than \$10?       |
| `<=`   | Less than or equal to    | Can this ride fit in my garage? |
| `>=`   | Greater than or equal to | Am I old enough to vote?        |

Let’s try some examples:

``` julia
# Temperature comparison
temp = 25
is_freezing = (temp <= 0)
println("Is it freezing? $is_freezing")
```

    Is it freezing? false

``` julia
# Price comparison
budget = 50
price = 45
can_afford = (budget >= price)
println("Can I afford it? $can_afford")
```

    Can I afford it? true

## Exercise 1.1 - Compare if 10 is greater than 5

Compare if 10 is greater than 5 and store the result in `comparison1`.

``` julia
# YOUR CODE BELOW
```

<details class="code-fold">
<summary>Code</summary>

``` julia
# Test your answer
@assert comparison1 == true
println("comparison1 is ", comparison1)
```

</details>

## Exercise 1.2 - Compare if x is not equal to y

Define variables `x` with value `"Hello"` and `y` with value `"world"`.
Compare if `x` is not equal to `y` and store the result in
`comparison2`.

``` julia
# YOUR CODE BELOW
```

<details class="code-fold">
<summary>Code</summary>

``` julia
# Test your answer
@assert x == "Hello"
@assert y == "world"
@assert comparison2 == true
println("Comparison2 is ", comparison2)
```

</details>

# Section 2 - Logical Operators

Sometimes we need to combine multiple comparisons in our code, just like
in real life decisions:

- “Can I go to the party?” might depend on:
  - (Is it weekend?) AND (Have I finished my studies?)
- “Should I take an umbrella?” might depend on:
  - (Is it raining?) OR (Is it likely to rain?)

Julia uses three main logical operators:

``` julia
# AND (&&): Both conditions must be true
can_go_to_party = (is_weekend && homework_done)

# OR (||): At least one condition must be true
need_umbrella = (is_raining || forecast_says_rain)

# NOT (!): Opposite of the condition
is_closed = !is_open
```

Real-world Examples:

``` julia
# Can I buy this game?
age = 25
money = 60
game_price = 50
can_buy = (age >= 18) && (money >= game_price)
println("Can I buy the game? $can_buy")
```

    Can I buy the game? true

``` julia
# Should I wear a coat?
temperature = 5
is_raining = true
need_coat = (temperature < 10) || is_raining
println("Should I wear a coat? $need_coat")
```

    Should I wear a coat? true

> [!TIP]
>
> Think of those logical operators as follows:
>
> - `&&` (AND) as a strict condition - everything must be perfect
> - `||` (OR) as a lenient condition - any good reason is enough
> - `!` (NOT) as the opposite of something

## Exercise 2.1 - Use the AND operator

Use the `AND` operator to check if `10` is greater than `5` and `hello`
is equal to `hello`. Store the result in `logic1`.

``` julia
# YOUR CODE BELOW
```

<details class="code-fold">
<summary>Code</summary>

``` julia
# Test your answer
@assert logic1 == true
println("logic1 is ", logic1)
```

</details>

## Exercise 2.2 - Use the OR operator

Use the `OR` operator to check if `10` is less than `5` or `hello` is
equal to `hello`. Store the result in `logic2`.

``` julia
# YOUR CODE BELOW
```

<details class="code-fold">
<summary>Code</summary>

``` julia
# Test your answer
@assert logic2 == true
println("logic2 is ", logic2)
```

</details>

> [!TIP]
>
> Julia uses short-circuit evaluation for `&&` and `||` operators. This
> means that the second operand is only evaluated if necessary.

## Exercise 2.3 - Use the NOT operator

Check whether `10` is greater than `5` and store the result in `logic3`.
Then, use the `NOT` operator to invert `logic3`. Store the result in
`logic4`.

``` julia
# YOUR CODE BELOW
```

<details class="code-fold">
<summary>Code</summary>

``` julia
# Test your answer
@assert logic3 == true
@assert logic4 == false
println("logic3 is ", logic3," and logic4 is", logic4)
```

</details>

## Exercise 2.4 - Chaining Comparisons

Julia has a neat feature that lets you write comparisons the way you
think about them:

``` julia
# Instead of writing:
age >= 13 && age <= 19    # Is age between 13 and 19?

# You can write:
13 <= age <= 19          # Much more natural!
```

Real-world examples:

``` julia
# Is the body temperature normal?
normal_temperature = (36.5 <= body_temp <= 37.5)

# Is the current hour within working hours?
working_hours = (9 <= current_hour < 17)
```

Check if `x` is between `1` and `10` (exclusive) using a chained
comparison. Store the result in `chained_comparison`.

``` julia
x = 5
# YOUR CODE BELOW
```

<details class="code-fold">
<summary>Code</summary>

``` julia
# Test your answer
@assert chained_comparison == true
println("chained_comparison is ", chained_comparison)
```

</details>

# Conclusion

Excellent work! You’ve completed the tutorial on Comparisons and logical
operators in Julia. You’ve learned to compare values and use logical
operators to combine or invert boolean values. Experiment with the code,
try different operations, and understand how Julia handles logic.

# Solutions

You will find the solutions to all exercises online
[here](https://github.com/beyondsimulations/Optimization-with-Julia) in
the `solutions` folders for each part. However, I strongly encourage you
to work on these exercises independently without searching explicitly
for the exact answers to the exercises. Understanding someone else’s
solution is very different from developing your own. Use the lecture
notes and try to solve the exercises on your own. This approach will
significantly enhance your learning and problem-solving skills.

Remember, the goal is not just to complete the exercises, but to
understand the concepts and improve your programming abilities. If you
encounter difficulties, review the lecture materials, experiment with
different approaches, and don’t hesitate to ask for clarification during
class discussions.
