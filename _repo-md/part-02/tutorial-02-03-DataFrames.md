# Tutorial II.III - DataFrames in Julia


# Introduction

Imagine a DataFrame as a digital spreadsheet. It’s a way to organize and
work with data in rows and columns. Each column can hold different types
of information, like names, ages, or salaries. In this tutorial, we’ll
learn how to create DataFrames, add and change data, and perform simple
operations on our data.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Before we start, make sure you have the DataFrames package installed.
> If you’re not sure how to do this, check the previous tutorial on
> package management!

Let’s begin by importing the DataFrames package:

``` julia
# Import the DataFrames package
using DataFrames
```

# Section 1 - Creating DataFrames

A DataFrame in Julia is akin to a table in SQL or a spreadsheet - each
column can have its own type, making it highly versatile. A DataFrame
can be created using the DataFrame constructor and passing key-value
pairs where the key is the column name and the value is an array of
data. For more help, use `?` in the REPL and type `DataFrame`. Example:

``` julia
students = DataFrame(
    Name = ["Elio", "Bob", "Yola"], 
    Age = [18, 25,29], 
)
```

<div><div style = "float: left;"><span>3×2 DataFrame</span></div><div style = "clear: both;"></div></div><div class = "data-frame" style = "overflow-x: scroll;">

| Row | Name   |   Age |
|----:|:-------|------:|
|     | String | Int64 |
|   1 | Elio   |    18 |
|   2 | Bob    |    25 |
|   3 | Yola   |    29 |

</div>

## Exercise 1.1 - Create a DataFrame

Create and Test a DataFrame. Create a DataFrame named `employees` with
the columns `Name`, `Age`, and `Salary`, and populate it with the
specified data: John is `28` years old and earns `50000`, Mike is `23`
years old and earns `62000`. Frank is `37` years old and earns `90000`.

``` julia
# YOUR CODE BELOW
```

<details class="code-fold">
<summary>Code</summary>

``` julia
# Test your answer
@assert employees == DataFrame(
    Name = ["John", "Mike", "Frank"], 
    Age = [28, 23, 37], 
    Salary = [50000, 62000, 90000]
)
println("DataFrame created successfully!")
println(employees)
```

</details>

# Section 2 - Accessing and Modifying Data

Accessing columns in a DataFrame can be done using the dot syntax, while
rows can be accessed via indexing. Modification of data is
straightforward; just assign a new value to the desired cell. To access
the column ‘name’ in our DataFrame with `employees`, we could do:

``` julia
employees.Name
```

    3-element Vector{String}:
     "John"
     "Mike"
     "Frank"

To access the third name specifically, we could do:

``` julia
employees.Name[3]
```

    "Frank"

## Exercise 2.1 - Access the `Age` Column

Access the `Age` column from the DataFrame and save it in a new variable
`ages`.

``` julia
# YOUR CODE BELOW
```

<details class="code-fold">
<summary>Code</summary>

``` julia
# Test your answer
@assert ages == [28, 23, 37]
println("Correct, the Ages column is: ", ages)
```

</details>

## Exercise 2.2 - Update John’s Salary

Update John’s salary to `59000`.

``` julia
# YOUR CODE BELOW
```

<details class="code-fold">
<summary>Code</summary>

``` julia
# Test your answer
@assert employees.Salary[1] == 59000
println("Modified DataFrame: ")
println(employees)
```

</details>

# Section 3 - Filtering Data

Logical indexing can be used to filter rows in a DataFrame based on
conditions. To filter the DataFrame to include only employees names
“Frank” we could do:

``` julia
allFranks = employees[employees.Name .== "Frank", :]
```

<div><div style = "float: left;"><span>1×3 DataFrame</span></div><div style = "clear: both;"></div></div><div class = "data-frame" style = "overflow-x: scroll;">

| Row | Name   |   Age | Salary |
|----:|:-------|------:|-------:|
|     | String | Int64 |  Int64 |
|   1 | Frank  |    37 |  90000 |

</div>

Alternatively, the filter function provides a powerful tool to extract
subsets of data based on a condition:

``` julia
allFranks = filter(row -> row.Name == "Frank", employees)
```

<div><div style = "float: left;"><span>1×3 DataFrame</span></div><div style = "clear: both;"></div></div><div class = "data-frame" style = "overflow-x: scroll;">

| Row | Name   |   Age | Salary |
|----:|:-------|------:|-------:|
|     | String | Int64 |  Int64 |
|   1 | Frank  |    37 |  90000 |

</div>

## Exercise 3.1 - Filter the DataFrame

Filter the DataFrame to include only employees with salaries above
`60000`. Save the resulting employees in the DataFrame `high_earners`.

``` julia
# YOUR CODE BELOW
```

<details class="code-fold">
<summary>Code</summary>

``` julia
# Test your answer
@assert nrow(high_earners) == 2
println("High earners: ")
println(high_earners)
```

</details>

# Section 4 - Basic Data Manipulation

Julia provides functions for basic data manipulation tasks, including
sorting, grouping, and joining DataFrames. The `sort` function can be
used to order the rows in a DataFrame based on the values in one or more
columns. To see how to use the function, type `?` into the REPL
(terminal) and type `sort`.

## Exercise 4.1 - Sort the DataFrame

Sort the DataFrame based on the `Age` column and save it as `sorted_df`.

``` julia
# YOUR CODE BELOW
```

<details class="code-fold">
<summary>Code</summary>

``` julia
# Test your answer
@assert sorted_df.Age[1] == 23
println("DataFrame sorted by age: ")
println(sorted_df)
```

> files which can be used to work with all kind of differently
> structured data sets.

# Section 5 - Loop over DataFrames

Sometimes, you might need to iterate over the rows of a DataFrame to
perform operations on each row individually. Julia provides a convenient
way to do this using the `eachrow` function. For example, if we want to
check for each employee if they have a salary above 60000, we can do the
following:

``` julia
for row in eachrow(employees)
    if row.Salary > 60000
        println("$(row.Name) earns more than 60000")
    end
end
```

    Mike earns more than 60000
    Frank earns more than 60000

Here, the `row` holds all the values of the row as a `NamedTuple`. We
can access the values of a column then by using the dot syntax. To
create a new column, we can use the `push!` function. For example, to
create a new column called `VacationDays` in the `employees` DataFrame,
we can do one of the following:

``` julia
employees.VacationDays = [0 for row in eachrow(employees)]
employees.VacationDays .= 0
```

    3-element Vector{Int64}:
     0
     0
     0

## Exercise 5.1 - Loop over DataFrame

Create a new column called `Bonus` in the `employees` DataFrame. The
bonus should be calculated as 10% of the salary for employees over 30,
and 5% for those 30 and under. Use a loop to iterate over the rows and
calculate the bonus.

``` julia
# YOUR CODE BELOW
```

<details class="code-fold">
<summary>Code</summary>

``` julia
# Test your answer
@assert filter(
    row -> row.Bonus == 2950, 
    employees
).Name == ["John"] "John should have a bonus of 2950"
@assert filter(
    row -> row.Bonus == 3100, 
    employees
).Name == ["Mike"] "Mike should have a bonus of 3100"
@assert filter(
    row -> row.Bonus == 9000, 
    employees
).Name == ["Frank"] "Frank should have a bonus of 9000"
println("Great job! All the bonuses are correct!")
```

</details>

# Section 6 - Filling a new DataFrame with values

Do you remember the `push!` function? We can use it to fill a new
DataFrame with values. For example, we can create a new DataFrame called
`WorkingHours` and fill it with the values from the `employees`
DataFrame. Imagine that the company has a policy, where employees above
30 work 30 hours a week, and employees under 30 work 40 hours a week:

``` julia
# Create a new DataFrame
WorkingHours = DataFrame(
    Name = String[],
    Hours = Int[]
)
# Loop over the rows of the employees DataFrame
for row in eachrow(employees)
    if row.Age < 30
        push!(WorkingHours, (
            Name = row.Name, 
            Hours = 40
        ))
    else
        push!(WorkingHours, (
            Name = row.Name, 
            Hours = 30
        ))
    end
end
println(WorkingHours)
```

    3×2 DataFrame
     Row │ Name    Hours 
         │ String  Int64 
    ─────┼───────────────
       1 │ John       40
       2 │ Mike       40
       3 │ Frank      30

You will find the solutions to all exercises online
[here](https://github.com/beyondsimulations/Optimization-with-Julia) in
the `solutions` folders for each part. However, I strongly encourage you
to work on these exercises independently without searching explicitly
for the exact answers to the exercises. Understanding someone else’s
solution is very different from developing your own. Use the lecture
notes and try to solve the exercises on your own. This approach will
significantly enhance your learning and problem-solving skills.

Remember, the goal is not just to complete the exercises, but to
understand the concepts and improve your programming abilities. If you
encounter difficulties, review the lecture materials, experiment with
different approaches, and don’t hesitate to ask for clarification during
class discussions.
