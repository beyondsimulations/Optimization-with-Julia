# Tutorial II.IV - Input and Output


# Introduction

Welcome to this interactive Julia tutorial on working with external
files! File Input/Output (I/O) operations are crucial in programming and
data analysis, allowing us to persist data, share information between
programs, and work with large datasets that don’t fit in memory. In this
tutorial, we’ll cover reading and writing text files, handling CSV
files, and working with delimited files using various Julia packages.
These skills are fundamental for data preprocessing, analysis, and
result storage in real-world applications.

Follow the instructions, write your code in the designated code blocks,
and validate your results with `@assert` statements.

# Section 1 - Working with Delimited Files

Delimited files, such as CSV (Comma-Separated Values), are a common way
to store structured data. Each value in the file is separated by a
specific character, often a comma. Julia’s DelimitedFiles package makes
it easy to work with these files.

> [!TIP]
>
> The DelimitedFiles package is part of Julia’s Standard Library, which
> means you can use it without installing anything extra!

``` julia
using DelimitedFiles
```

Now, let’s create a simple matrix and save it as a CSV file:

``` julia
# Create a 3x3 matrix
new_data = [10 12 6; 13 25 1; 40 30 7]

# Create a new folder called "ExampleData"
mkdir("$(@__DIR__)/ExampleData")

# Write the matrix to a CSV file
open("$(@__DIR__)/ExampleData/matrix.csv", "w") do io
    writedlm(io, new_data, ',')
end

println("CSV file 'matrix.csv' written successfully to folder ExampleData!")
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> Note, that we used the `@__DIR__` macro to get the directory of the
> current file. This is a convenient way to ensure that the file path is
> correct, no matter where you run the script from. The reason is, that
> the `@__DIR__` macro returns the directory of the file in which the
> macro is called, not the directory of the script you are running.

## Exercise 1.1 - Read a CSV File

Now it’s your turn! Let’s read the CSV file we just created.

> [!TIP]
>
> To learn how to use a Julia function, you can type `?` followed by the
> function name in the REPL (Julia’s command-line interface). For
> example, `?readdlm` will show you information about the `readdlm()`
> function.

Use the `readdlm()` function to read the ‘matrix.csv’ file we just
created. Save the result in a variable called `read_matrix`.

``` julia
# YOUR CODE BELOW
# Don't forget to use the @__DIR__ macro to get the correct file path!
```

<details class="code-fold">
<summary>Code</summary>

``` julia
# Test your answer
@assert read_matrix == new_data
println("File 'matrix.csv' read successfully!")
```

</details>

# Section 2 - Working with CSV Files and DataFrames

The CSV package in Julia provides powerful tools for reading and writing
CSV files to and from DataFrames, a common requirement in data analysis
and data science projects. This requires the CSV and DataFrames
packages. If you solely followed the course so far, you first have to
install the CSV Package before you can start using it:

``` julia
import Pkg; Pkg.add("CSV")
```

## Exercise 2.1 - Write a DataFrame to a CSV File

Write the following given DataFrame to a CSV file `table_out.csv` in the
folder `ExampleData`. This can be done by using the function
`CSV.write()`. To learn the syntax, ask the inbuild help with `?` and
the function name.

``` julia
using CSV, DataFrames
data = DataFrame(Name = ["Elio", "Bob", "Yola"], Age = [18, 25, 29])
csv_file_path = "$(@__DIR__)/ExampleData/table_out.csv"
# YOUR CODE BELOW
```

<details class="code-fold">
<summary>Code</summary>

``` julia
# Test your answer
@assert isfile("ExampleData/table_out.csv") "Sorry, the file could not be found. 
    Have you followed all steps?"
println("CSV file 'data.csv' written successfully!")
```

</details>

## Exercise 2.2 - Read a CSV File in

Read the CSV file `table_out.csv` in the folder `ExampleData` into the
variable `read_data`. Here you can use the function `CSV.read()`, e.g.:

``` julia
read_data = CSV.read("Path/datatable.csv", DataFrame)
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> Note, that you need to provide a sink for the data when using
> `CSV.read()`, e.g. a DataFrame.

``` julia
# YOUR CODE BELOW
# Again, don't forget to use the @__DIR__ macro to get the correct file path!
```

<details class="code-fold">
<summary>Code</summary>

``` julia
# Test your answer
@assert read_data[1,1] == "Elio"
println("CSV file 'table_out.csv' read successfully!")
```

</details>

# Conclusion

Congratulations! You’ve successfully completed the tutorial on reading
and writing external files in Julia. Continue to the next file to learn
more.

# Solutions

You will find the solutions to all exercises online
[here](https://github.com/beyondsimulations/Optimization-with-Julia) in
the `solutions` folders for each part. However, I strongly encourage you
to work on these exercises independently without searching explicitly
for the exact answers to the exercises. Understanding someone else’s
solution is very different from developing your own. Use the lecture
notes and try to solve the exercises on your own. This approach will
significantly enhance your learning and problem-solving skills.

Remember, the goal is not just to complete the exercises, but to
understand the concepts and improve your programming abilities. If you
encounter difficulties, review the lecture materials, experiment with
different approaches, and don’t hesitate to ask for clarification during
class discussions.
