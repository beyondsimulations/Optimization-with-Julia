# Tutorial III.II - Variables and Bounds in JuMP


# Introduction

Welcome to this beginner-friendly tutorial on variables and bounds in
JuMP! In this lesson, we’ll explore different types of variables and how
to set limits (or bounds) on them. Don’t worry if you’re new to
optimization - we’ll explain everything step by step using real-world
examples.

Follow the instructions, write your code in the designated code blocks,
and confirm your understanding with `@assert` statements. Make sure to
have the JuMP package installed to follow this tutorial.

Let’s start by loading the JuMP package:

``` julia
using JuMP
```

Now, let’s create a model that we’ll use throughout this tutorial:

``` julia
model = Model()
println("Great! We've created a new optimization model.")
```

    Great! We've created a new optimization model.

# Section 1 - Understanding Different Types of Variables

In optimization problems, we often need to represent different kinds of
decisions. JuMP allows us to use three main types of variables:

1.  **Continuous variables**: These can take any real value within a
    range. Example: The amount of water in a reservoir (can be any
    number, like 3.7 liters).

2.  **Integer variables**: These can only be whole numbers. Example: The
    number of cars produced in a factory (we can’t produce half a car!).

3.  **Binary variables**: These can only be 0 or 1. Example: Whether to
    build a new store in a location (yes = 1, no = 0).

Let’s see how to create each type:

``` julia
@variable(model, variableName)
```

This defines a continuous variable without any bound.

``` julia
@variable(model, 0 <= variableName2 <= 1)
has_lower_bound(variableName2) && has_upper_bound(variableName2)
```

This defines a continuous variable in an interval.

``` julia
@variable(model, variableName3, Bin)
is_binary(variableName3)
```

This defines a binary variable.

``` julia
@variable(model, 0 <= variableName4, Int) 
is_integer(variableName4)
```

This defines an integer variable.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Note that you will have to change `model` and `variableName` according
> to your instance.

## Exercise 1.1 - Create Variables

Now it’s your turn! Create three variables:

1.  A continuous variable called `water_amount`
2.  An integer variable called `cars_produced`
3.  A binary variable called `build_store`

``` julia
# YOUR CODE BELOW
# Hint: Use the @variable macro three times, once for each variable
```

<details class="code-fold">
<summary>Code</summary>

``` julia
# Test your answer
@assert typeof(water_amount) == VariableRef && !is_integer(water_amount) && !is_binary(water_amount)
@assert typeof(cars_produced) == VariableRef && is_integer(cars_produced)
@assert typeof(build_store) == VariableRef && is_binary(build_store)
println("Excellent work! You've successfully created continuous, integer, and binary variables.")
```

</details>

# Section 2 - Creating Variables in Containers

When we have many similar variables, it’s helpful to group them
together. JuMP allows us to use containers like arrays and matrices for
this purpose. For example:

``` julia
@variable(model, variableName5[1:20], Bin)
```

    20-element Vector{VariableRef}:
     variableName5[1]
     variableName5[2]
     variableName5[3]
     variableName5[4]
     variableName5[5]
     variableName5[6]
     variableName5[7]
     variableName5[8]
     variableName5[9]
     variableName5[10]
     variableName5[11]
     variableName5[12]
     variableName5[13]
     variableName5[14]
     variableName5[15]
     variableName5[16]
     variableName5[17]
     variableName5[18]
     variableName5[19]
     variableName5[20]

This would create a container with 20 variables. To create a set based
on a range, we could do:

``` julia
new_range = 1:100
@variable(model, variableName6[i in new_range] >= 0)
```

    1-dimensional DenseAxisArray{JuMP.VariableRef,1,...} with index sets:
        Dimension 1, 1:100
    And data, a 100-element Vector{JuMP.VariableRef}:
     variableName6[1]
     variableName6[2]
     variableName6[3]
     variableName6[4]
     variableName6[5]
     variableName6[6]
     variableName6[7]
     variableName6[8]
     variableName6[9]
     variableName6[10]
     ⋮
     variableName6[92]
     variableName6[93]
     variableName6[94]
     variableName6[95]
     variableName6[96]
     variableName6[97]
     variableName6[98]
     variableName6[99]
     variableName6[100]

This would create a container with 100 continuous variables larger than
0. For a container with multiple dimensions:

``` julia
@variable(model, variableName7[1:30, 1:30])
```

    30×30 Matrix{VariableRef}:
     variableName7[1,1]   variableName7[1,2]   …  variableName7[1,30]
     variableName7[2,1]   variableName7[2,2]      variableName7[2,30]
     variableName7[3,1]   variableName7[3,2]      variableName7[3,30]
     variableName7[4,1]   variableName7[4,2]      variableName7[4,30]
     variableName7[5,1]   variableName7[5,2]      variableName7[5,30]
     variableName7[6,1]   variableName7[6,2]   …  variableName7[6,30]
     variableName7[7,1]   variableName7[7,2]      variableName7[7,30]
     variableName7[8,1]   variableName7[8,2]      variableName7[8,30]
     variableName7[9,1]   variableName7[9,2]      variableName7[9,30]
     variableName7[10,1]  variableName7[10,2]     variableName7[10,30]
     ⋮                                         ⋱  
     variableName7[22,1]  variableName7[22,2]     variableName7[22,30]
     variableName7[23,1]  variableName7[23,2]     variableName7[23,30]
     variableName7[24,1]  variableName7[24,2]     variableName7[24,30]
     variableName7[25,1]  variableName7[25,2]     variableName7[25,30]
     variableName7[26,1]  variableName7[26,2]  …  variableName7[26,30]
     variableName7[27,1]  variableName7[27,2]     variableName7[27,30]
     variableName7[28,1]  variableName7[28,2]     variableName7[28,30]
     variableName7[29,1]  variableName7[29,2]     variableName7[29,30]
     variableName7[30,1]  variableName7[30,2]     variableName7[30,30]

This would create a container with a matrix of continuous variables
without any bound. Note that you will have to change `model` and
`variableName` according to your instance.

## Exercise 2.1 - Create an Array

Imagine you’re planning production for a week. Create an array
`daily_production` with 7 non-negative variables, one for each day of
the week.

``` julia
# YOUR CODE BELOW
```

<details class="code-fold">
<summary>Code</summary>

``` julia
# Test your answer
@assert length(daily_production) == 7
@assert all(lower_bound(daily_production[i]) == 0 for i in 1:7)
println("Great job! You've created an array of 7 non-negative variables for daily production.")
```

</details>

## Exercise 2.2 - Create a Matrix of Variables

Now, imagine you’re deciding whether to stock 4 different products in 3
different stores. Create a 3x4 matrix of binary variables called
`stock_decision`.

``` julia
# YOUR CODE BELOW
```

<details class="code-fold">
<summary>Code</summary>

``` julia
# Test your answer
@assert size(stock_decision) == (3, 4)
@assert all(is_binary(stock_decision[i,j]) for i in 1:3, j in 1:4)
println("Excellent! You've created a 3x4 matrix of binary variables for stocking decisions.")
```

</details>

# Section 3 - Setting Bounds on Variables

Often, we know that a variable can’t go below or above certain values.
We can set these limits (called bounds) when we create the variable.

For example, if a factory can produce between 100 and 500 units:

``` julia
@variable(model, 100 <= production <= 500)
```

Or if we know a percentage must be between 0 and 100:

``` julia
@variable(model, 0 <= percentage <= 100)
```

## Exercise 3.1 - Set Bounds on a Variable

Create a variable `temperature` that represents the temperature setting
on a thermostat. It should be between 0 and 37 degrees.

``` julia
# YOUR CODE BELOW
```

<details class="code-fold">
<summary>Code</summary>

``` julia
# Test your answer
@assert lower_bound(temperature) == 0
@assert upper_bound(temperature) == 37
println("Well done! You've created a variable for temperature with appropriate bounds.")
```

</details>

# Conclusion

Fantastic! You’ve completed the tutorial on advanced variables in JuMP.
You’ve learned how to create variables in containers, manage different
types of variables, and work with indexed variables. Continue to the
next file to learn more.

# Solutions

You will find the solutions to all exercises online
[here](https://github.com/beyondsimulations/Optimization-with-Julia) in
the `solutions` folders for each part. However, I strongly encourage you
to work on these exercises independently without searching explicitly
for the exact answers to the exercises. Understanding someone else’s
solution is very different from developing your own. Use the lecture
notes and try to solve the exercises on your own. This approach will
significantly enhance your learning and problem-solving skills.

Remember, the goal is not just to complete the exercises, but to
understand the concepts and improve your programming abilities. If you
encounter difficulties, review the lecture materials, experiment with
different approaches, and don’t hesitate to ask for clarification during
class discussions.
