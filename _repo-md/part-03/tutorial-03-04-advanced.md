# Tutorial III.IV - Advanced Solver Options with HiGHS in JuMP


# Introduction

Welcome to this tutorial on advanced solver options in JuMP using the
HiGHS solver! Don’t worry if “advanced solver options” sounds
intimidating - we’ll break everything down into simple,
easy-to-understand concepts.

Imagine you’re using a GPS app to find the best route to a new
restaurant. Just like how you can adjust settings in your GPS (like
avoiding toll roads or preferring highways), we can adjust settings in
our optimization solver to help it find solutions more efficiently or to
meet specific requirements.

By the end of this tutorial, you’ll be able to: 1. Understand what
solver options are and why they’re useful 2. Set basic solver options
like time limits and solution tolerances 3. Interpret solver output to
understand how well your problem was solved

Let’s start by loading the necessary packages:

``` julia
using JuMP, HiGHS
```

# Section 1: Understanding Solver Options

Solver options are like the “advanced settings” of our optimization
tool. They allow us to control how the solver approaches our problem.
Here are a few common options:

1.  **Time limit**: How long the solver should try before giving up
2.  **Solution tolerance**: How precise we need the answer to be
3.  **Presolve**: Whether to simplify the problem before solving it

Let’s create a model and set some of these options:

``` julia
model = Model(HiGHS.Optimizer)

# Set a time limit of 60 seconds
set_time_limit_sec(model, 60)

# Set the relative MIP gap tolerance to 1%
set_optimizer_attribute(model, "mip_rel_gap", 0.01)

# Turn on presolve
set_optimizer_attribute(model, "presolve", "on")

println("Solver options set successfully!")
```

    Solver options set successfully!

Let’s break this down:

- `set_time_limit_sec(model, 60)` tells the solver to stop after 60
  seconds if it hasn’t found a solution
- `set_optimizer_attribute(model, "mip_rel_gap", 0.01)` sets how close
  to the best possible solution we need to be (within 1%)
- `set_optimizer_attribute(model, "presolve", "on")` tells the solver to
  try simplifying the problem first

## Exercise 1.1 - Set Solver Options

Now it’s your turn! Set the following solver options: 1. A time limit of
120 seconds 2. A MIP gap tolerance of 0.5% 3. Turn off presolve

``` julia
# YOUR CODE BELOW
```

<details class="code-fold">
<summary>Code</summary>

``` julia
# Test your answer
@assert time_limit_sec(model) == 120 "The time limit should be 120 seconds but is $(time_limit_sec(model))"
@assert solver_name(model) == "HiGHS" "The solver should be HiGHS but is $(solver_name(model))"
@assert MOI.get(model, MOI.RawOptimizerAttribute("mip_rel_gap")) == 0.005 "The MIP gap should be 0.5% but is $(MOI.get(model, MOI.RawOptimizerAttribute("mip_rel_gap")))"
@assert MOI.get(model, MOI.RawOptimizerAttribute("presolve")) == "off" "Presolve should be off but is $(MOI.get(model, MOI.RawOptimizerAttribute("presolve")))"
println("Great job! You've successfully set advanced solver options.")
```

</details>

# Section 2: Creating and Solving a Sample Problem

To see how these options affect solving, let’s create a simple
optimization problem. We’ll use a basic production planning scenario.

Imagine you’re managing a small factory that produces two types of
products: widgets and gadgets. You want to maximize profit while staying
within your production capacity.

``` julia
# Define variables
@variable(model, widgets >= 0, Int) 
@variable(model, gadgets >= 0, Int)

# Define constraints
@constraint(model, 
    production_time, 
    2*widgets + 3*gadgets <= 240
) 
@constraint(model, 
    widget_demand, 
    widgets <= 80
)  
@constraint(model, 
    gadget_demand, 
    gadgets <= 60
)

# Define objective (profit)
@objective(model, 
    Max, 
    25*widgets + 30*gadgets
)

# Solve the problem
optimize!(model)

# Print results
println("Optimization status: ", termination_status(model))
println("Objective value: ", objective_value(model))
println("Widgets to produce: ", value(widgets))
println("Gadgets to produce: ", value(gadgets))
```

This problem determines how many widgets and gadgets to produce to
maximize profit, given time constraints and maximum demand.

## Exercise 2.1 - Modify and Solve the Problem

Now it’s your turn! Modify the problem above by:

1.  Changing the production time constraint to 300 minutes
2.  Increasing the profit for widgets to 30
3.  Solving the modified problem and printing the results

``` julia
# YOUR CODE BELOW
# Hint: Copy the code above and make the necessary changes
model = Model(HiGHS.Optimizer) # Don't forget to re-initialize the model
```

<details class="code-fold">
<summary>Code</summary>

``` julia
# Test your answer
@assert termination_status(model) == MOI.OPTIMAL "The termination status should be OPTIMAL but is $(termination_status(model))"
@assert isapprox(objective_value(model), 3780, atol=1e-6) "The objective value should be 3780 but is $(objective_value(model))"
@assert isapprox(value(widgets), 80, atol=1e-6) "The number of widgets to produce should be 80 but is $(value(widgets))"
@assert isapprox(value(gadgets), 46, atol=1e-6) "The number of gadgets to produce should be 46 but is $(value(gadgets))"
println("Excellent work! You've successfully modified and solved the optimization problem.")
```

# Section 3: Interpreting Solver Output

When we solve an optimization problem, the solver gives us information
about how it went. Let’s look at some key pieces of information:

``` julia
println("Termination status: ", termination_status(model))
println("Primal status: ", primal_status(model))
println("Dual status: ", dual_status(model))
println("Objective value: ", objective_value(model))
println("Solve time: ", solve_time(model))
```

Let’s break this down:

- **Termination status**: Tells if the solver found an optimal solution,
  ran out of time, etc.
- **Primal status**: Indicates if we have a valid solution for our
  original problem
- **Dual status**: Relates to the mathematical properties of the
  solution (don’t worry too much about this)
- **Objective value**: The value of our objective function (in this
  case, our profit)
- **Solve time**: How long it took to solve the problem

# Conclusion

Well done! You’ve completed the tutorial on advanced solver options with
HiGHS in JuMP. You’ve learned how to set advanced solver options.
Continue to the next file to learn more.

# Solutions

You will find the solutions to all exercises online
[here](https://github.com/beyondsimulations/Optimization-with-Julia) in
the `solutions` folders for each part. However, I strongly encourage you
to work on these exercises independently without searching explicitly
for the exact answers to the exercises. Understanding someone else’s
solution is very different from developing your own. Use the lecture
notes and try to solve the exercises on your own. This approach will
significantly enhance your learning and problem-solving skills.

Remember, the goal is not just to complete the exercises, but to
understand the concepts and improve your programming abilities. If you
encounter difficulties, review the lecture materials, experiment with
different approaches, and don’t hesitate to ask for clarification during
class discussions.
