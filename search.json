    "section": "",
    "text": "Description\nThis small workshop will introduce you to the basics of mathematical optimization using Julia. Throughout the workshop, you will learn the basics of Julia and JuMP, the de facto standard for mathematical optimization in Julia. We will work with simple, practical examples to help you understand the core concepts. You will learn how to formulate basic optimization problems and translate them into code. The workshop was originally part of the course Applied Optimization but it is now also offered as a standalone small workshop.\n\n\nLearning Outcomes\nMy goal is to introduce you to the Julia programming language and the JuMP package for mathematical optimization. Both are widely used in academia and industry and are great tools to know. Julia is a fast, flexible, and powerful programming language that is becoming more and more popular in academia and industry. JuMP is a package that allows you to formulate and solve optimization problems in Julia, it is an alternative to other popular optimization software such as GAMS, AMPL, Pyomo, etc.\nUpon completion of the workshop, you will be able to:\n\nApply the basics of the Julia programming language\nImplement basic optimization problems in Julia\nUnderstand the core concepts of optimization\nApply optimization techniques to practical problems\n\nPlease note that this workshop is designed to be accessible to everyone, including complete beginners. No advanced knowledge or experience in programming is required to follow along, although knowledge of programming is helpful! The teaching format accommodates different levels of programming skills, ensuring that every participant can get the most out of the workshop.\n\n\nCourse Blocks\nThe core content of the workshop is organized in four blocks:\n\nIntroduction\nPart I: Variables and Types\nPart II: Functions, Data Frames and Plots\nPart III: Optimization with JuMP\n\n\n\nTutorials\nThe workshop is organized in a series of tutorials. Each tutorial is a self-contained document that you can run online in Google Colab or download and run locally.\n\nYou can find the content for each part in the corresponding folder\nTo run the code, you can use VS Code or Google Colab\nTo do so, download the corresponding .ipynb file and open it in VS Code or Google Colab\n\n\n\nQuestions\nIf you have any questions regarding the workshop, please contact me under tobias.vlcek@uni-hamburg.de.",

Understanding variables and their types is crucial as they are the building blocks of any program. They determine how data is stored, manipulated, and how efficiently your code runs.\nThis script is designed to be interactive. Follow the instructions, write your code in the designated code blocks, and then execute the corresponding code. Each exercise is followed by an @assert statement that checks your solution.\nThere are two ways to run the code:\n\nThe easiest way to run the code is by using VS Code. First, install the Julia and the Jupyter Extension. Then, you can open the downloaded .ipynb files and run the code from there.\nThe second way is by using IJulia. Start Julia, and type using IJulia; notebook() in the Julia prompt. This will open a new browser window where you can run the code. If you have not installed IJulia yet, you can do so by typing ] in the Julia prompt to open the package manager, and then installing IJulia by typing add IJulia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAlways replace ‘YOUR CODE BELOW’ with your actual code.",

    "text": "Welcome to this beginner-friendly guide on understanding packages and package management in Julia!\nThink of packages as pre-written sets of tools that extend what Julia can do. It’s like having a toolbox where you can add new tools (packages) to help you solve specific problems. For example, there are packages for working with data, creating visualizations, or solving complex math problems.\nThe best part? Most Julia packages are free to use, thanks to the open-source community!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhile we’ll practice some commands here, you’ll typically manage packages in Julia’s REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop), which is like Julia’s command center.",
